            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Thought I had done with the <hi>Preſs,</hi> and was concluding, that I ſhould Trouble it no more. But I find yet another <hi>Cauſe</hi> to Plead, further than my Voice can be Heard. And in the <hi>Defence</hi> of that Cauſe, I ſend this <hi>Sound</hi> into the World, and would have theſe <hi>Papers</hi> to Speak, as well as they can, even when I am <hi>Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the too Common <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> of God's Worſhip, in ſo many Families, Obſerved and Bewailed by all, whoſe Eyes he has Opened, which might give ſufficient <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54105:3"/>for the preſent <hi>Exhortation:</hi> A very Pious <hi>Lady,</hi> for whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſon, and Exemplary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, I have a juſt Eſteem and high Regard, was pleas'd to deſire this of me, That in the next Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my <hi>Prayer Book,</hi> I would add more than I had there ſaid in the <hi>Preface,</hi> to put all <hi>Families</hi> upon their <hi>Prayers.</hi> That I might not only ſhew ſuch as needed the Help, <hi>How</hi> they ſhould do it: But alſo (if poſſible) be Inſtrumental, ſo to <hi>Prevail</hi> with them, that they might not ſtill leave it <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſome late Obſervations that I have made, give me cauſe to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large</hi> the Complaint in that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, of the <hi>Dulneſs and Indifferency of Sinful Men, to that which is best for them, and which most highly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them; That they are not apt to be Solicitous, (ſo as they uſe to ſhew themſelves in their Worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns) to Seek after the Proviſions and Conveniencies for the Spiritual
<pb facs="tcp:54105:3"/>Life, unleſs theſe fall directly in their way, and are ſet juſt before them.</hi> For I find that ſome will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, but ſo much as to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> them, even when they have them <hi>Ready</hi> by them.</p>
            <p>Now, though the <hi>Impreſſion</hi> of that Imperfect <hi>Piece</hi> is gone off; yet I am not Determined by thoſe Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations, which would put me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Another.</hi> Becauſe my End be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already gain'd; in ſeeing it <hi>Communicated,</hi> and all Hands filled, as far as I thought my ſelf <hi>Obliged:</hi> I have no Motive now to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerned: Unleſs it were to make ſuch <hi>Corrections,</hi> and to fill up ſuch <hi>Defects,</hi> as might give my ſelf (if not others) ſome better <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in that Performance.</p>
            <p>But what I have here to offer, would be too Large to be Inſerted in a <hi>Preface:</hi> And the Time alſo might be too <hi>Long,</hi> to wait for that Opportunity. Therefore this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> to Souls, I now give out by
<pb facs="tcp:54105:4"/>itſelf And though, I know, it might be much better done by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, if they would think fit ſo to Concern themſelves; yet in the mean time, accept it in ſuch manner, as can at preſent be done, by one that is full of <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> to Promote it as far as lies in the Power of</p>

Rich in Faith, and Grace, and Good Works: Which is the true <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and the Greateſt <hi>Wealth.</hi> For our Bleſſed Saviour has taught us, That a Man may get the <hi>whole</hi> World, and be never the better, but <hi>Undone</hi> for ever.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54105:16"/>and our Intereſt in it. Our Title to it, and what we have to ſhew for it? Now Prayer is the <hi>Key</hi> to <hi>Unlock</hi> all theſe Treaſures; For it is but <hi>Ask and Have.</hi> Surely, The moſt <hi>Compendious</hi> Art of Thriving; The quickeſt and Eaſieſt way to be <hi>Rich:</hi> To get all, and Coſt you nothing: Never a <hi>Penny;</hi> Nor any <hi>Turning and Winding;</hi> unleſs it be of your Prayers.

            <p>This Way of Prayer, is God's own <hi>Appointed</hi> Means; abundantly to Benefit Souls.

            <p>Thus much I have to ſay for the <hi>Family-Prayer.</hi> And now let us hear, what any has to ſay againſt it. 'Tis wonder if it be not <hi>contradicted:</hi> Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the great Ruler of the Darkneſs of this World has no <hi>Advocates</hi> in it, to Plead his Cauſe; which, by this means, ſeems in danger to be ſo much <hi>Damnified.</hi> Some Objections I have <hi>Heard.</hi> And ſome I do ſuſpect, that I not expect to <hi>Hear.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54105:22"/>For there are <hi>Colourable</hi> Excuſes for the neglect; that uſe to be <hi>alledged:</hi> And there are <hi>Real</hi> Cauſes of it, that lie <hi>Concealed:</hi> As not thought fit to be <hi>mentioned.</hi> I ſhall take Notice of both. And of the former ſort are, The want of a <hi>Command,</hi> The want of <hi>Time,</hi> The want of <hi>Ability,</hi> The want of <hi>Company,</hi> for it: And the want of <hi>Succeſs</hi> in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

And I know from what <hi>Quarter</hi> this Wind uſes to blow. But 'tis well, that if is but <hi>Wind;</hi> and that there is ſo little <hi>Reaſon</hi> for it.

            <p>Now is not this a Sad and Fearful Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that may ſtrike you down, and make you <hi>Tremble;</hi> To think that your <hi>Strangeneſs</hi> to God, ariſes from this <hi>Enmity;</hi> and that therefore you are <hi>Prayerleſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>Enemies?</hi> At <hi>Odds</hi> with your Glorious Maker, and up in <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the King of Heaven? And then, O what do you mean to do? Will you ſtand it out, and Prepare for <hi>Battel;</hi> and go try <hi>Strength</hi> with the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty? Are you for the <hi>Encounter?</hi> And dare you <hi>Reſiſt,</hi> and Venture to Bear the <hi>Shock</hi> of his Indignation? O Sottiſh Creatures!

It muſt be another way, that you <hi>Prepare</hi> to Meet your God. And that is, To go and Caſt your ſelves at his <hi>Feet,</hi> and aſſwage his <hi>Wrath</hi> with your <hi>Prayers;</hi> and Beg Pardon and Peace, for his <hi>Son</hi>'s Merits. For you will ſind <hi>Judgment</hi> without Mercy, if you do not make your Peace in this Time of <hi>Mercy.</hi> You will be Torn in <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> when there ſhall be none to <hi>Deliver,</hi> if of the Offended Majeſty himſelf you do not obtain <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi> from this Curſed <hi>Enmity. Acquaint now thy ſelf with him, and be at Peace: Thereby Good ſhall come unto thee,</hi> Job 22.21. Yea <hi>thou ſhalt make thy Prayer to him, and he ſhall hear thee,</hi> ver. 27. That's a Wonderful <hi>Indulgence;</hi> for <hi>Enemies,</hi> who lye all at his <hi>Mercy,</hi> to be admitted to <hi>Parley.</hi> That he will allow you to come, and <hi>Speak</hi> for your ſelves. Yea, that he <hi>puts</hi> you upon this very Courſe: And the Gracious God, (wronged and offended,) <hi>ſeeks</hi> firſt, to have all <hi>Accommodated</hi> and Healed. And will you not then take the <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Offer,</hi> while you may have it? Yea, and when <hi>we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, to be Reconciled unto God?</hi> If ever you will ſhew <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to do you any Good, ſhew it here: and ſhew it <hi>Quickly.

            <p n="6">6. One other Cauſe, (near a-kin to this,) of withholding the Prayers, is <hi>The Love of Sin. When Wickedneſs is ſweet in the Mouth, and</hi> (as u pleaſant Morſel,) <hi>is Hid under the Tongue,</hi> Job 20.12.

That which makes thee <hi>Abaſh'd</hi> before the Lord, will be apt to Keep thee out of his <hi>Preſence.</hi> When thy doing is ſo <hi>Inconſiſtent</hi> with thy Praying; and thou knoweſt where is the <hi>Stop,</hi> and what is the <hi>Matter,</hi> That God Hides his <hi>Face</hi> from thee, and will have nothing to do with thee, till thou haſt done with the <hi>provoking</hi> thing: Then thou hangeſt <hi>back</hi> from the <hi>Galling</hi> Office; and trieſt to <hi>Divert</hi> and Eaſe thy ſelf ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. And what Heart haſt thou to Seek the <hi>Face</hi> of the Lord, which his Word tells thee is <hi>Againſt them that do Evil,</hi> Pſal. 34.16.

The way of <hi>Frayer</hi> is utterly <hi>Croſs</hi> to the Courſe of his Life. And to Draw Nigh to the Holy Righteous Lord, does nothing but Upbraid and <hi>Torment</hi> him.

After you have each conſulted your ſeveral <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,</hi> for the <hi>fitteſt</hi> Seaſons, which you find to be moſt Proper and Advantageous for the Purpoſe: <hi>Determine</hi> the Time with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54105:44"/>and let your People know, that then you <hi>Expect</hi> their Attendance with you before the Lord.

            <p>Yet further, Let me urge the <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> as well as Decency of this Duty. If ever you would be <hi>ſafe,</hi> and <hi>Do Well,</hi> Do not <hi>Vonture</hi> out in the Morning without this <hi>Guard</hi> and Defence of your <hi>Prayers</hi> about you.

You know not what <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Perils</hi> you ſhall meet with; nor what is near you, or juſt hanging over you: In ſuch an <hi>Evil</hi> Dangerous World, wherein you Live, Beſet with ſuch a Mighty and Deadly <hi>Enemy;</hi> that is ſtill watching and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for your <hi>Miſchief</hi> and <hi>Ruin:</hi> And when you are ſo weak and <hi>Inſufficient,</hi> to maintain either your <hi>Integrity</hi> or your <hi>Safety;</hi> and 'tis as much as you can do, with all your Prayers, to <hi>ſecure</hi> your ſelves. O what will become of you then, if you get not under the Shelter of the <hi>Almighty?</hi> If you Engage not his Aid in your <hi>Defence?</hi> You are never out of <hi>Harms</hi> way, when <hi>out</hi> with God. However you may <hi>Fancy</hi> your ſelves ſafe and well enough, even under the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Power: (For ſo he will ſeek to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour you, into your own Undoing:) All your
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54105:46"/>Security and Proſperity then, Alas, it is but a <hi>Dream</hi> and Imagination; when you are out of God's <hi>Hands;</hi> and will not by Prayer, commit your ſelves to his <hi>Tuition.</hi> That which looks for your <hi>Welfare</hi> then will prove but a <hi>Trap:</hi> And even the things in which you <hi>Applaud</hi> your ſelves, as <hi>Beſt</hi> for you, will turn to your <hi>Downfall</hi> and Ruin.</p>
            <p>Once more,</p>
            <p>You have as much Need of your <hi>Morning-Prayers,</hi> as you have of the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all your Deſigns and Labours of the <hi>Day.</hi> For how <hi>Vain is it, To Riſe Early, and Sit up Late, and Eat the Bread of Carefulneſs and Sorrow,</hi> Pſal. 127.2. If the Lord do not give <hi>Succeſs,</hi> and make your Endeavours <hi>Proſperous?</hi> The beſt <hi>Contrivance,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Pains</hi> will never do, without his Favour and gracious <hi>Influence.</hi> All your <hi>Planting and Watering</hi> will ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>If he do not give the Increaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.7.

O then <hi>Begin</hi> all your Works in God's Holy <hi>Name;</hi> and let your <hi>Prayers</hi> go before your <hi>Labours.</hi> And never think that all your <hi>other</hi> Striving will do greater matters, than this Striving with God for the <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> Nor think to <hi>Snatch</hi> it out of God's Hands, and work it out your ſelves, whether <hi>He</hi> will or no: But before you Engage in the <hi>Work</hi> of the Day, Stay to Engage and Pray him into your <hi>Intereſts.</hi> And inſtead of fearing any <hi>Damage</hi> by this Courſe, Expect to Fare the <hi>Better</hi> all Day Long, for your <hi>Morning</hi> Devotions.</p>

And if one Steals to <hi>Bed</hi> before Prayer-time, and this and the other <hi>Run</hi> out, and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>other</hi> Employment: It is thy <hi>Fault,</hi> as a <hi>Maſter,</hi> that thou doſt not uſe thy Authority, to <hi>Oblige</hi> them to better Attendance: And ſee that ye take this fair <hi>Leave</hi> of one another, before you part; to call upon the <hi>Lord</hi> with one Conſent, and <hi>Magnify his Name together.</hi> That you may not only in a Formality, ſay, <hi>Good Night;</hi> but have good Reaſon to <hi>Hope</hi> it: And be like indeed to find Souls-Reſt in your <hi>God,</hi> as well as the Bodily Reſt in your <hi>Beds:</hi> And not go away with <hi>Regret</hi> of Conſcience, for making your Beds your Lurking Holes; where to <hi>Hide</hi> from the Lord and <hi>Out-run</hi> your Duty.</p>
            <p>Again, If you have <hi>Forgot</hi> your ſelves, in the <hi>Hurry</hi> of the Day: At Night is the Time of <hi>Recollection,</hi> to call your ſelves to Account, and go <hi>Humble</hi> your ſelves to the Majeſty <hi>Offended;</hi> And beg his merciful <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, for all that you have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly <hi>Omitted,</hi> or wickedly <hi>Committed,</hi> the Paſt Day.

            <p>And that is yet a further Engagement to your <hi>Evening Prayers,</hi> That you may be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from all the <hi>Dangers</hi> and <hi>Terrors</hi> of the Night. Not only from Fire and Thieves, but from the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God, and the <hi>Incurſions</hi> of Devils. That the Bleſſed Keeper of <hi>Iſrael</hi> may watch over you; when you are not in a Condition to take <hi>Care</hi> of your ſelves: And that you may be Preſerved ſafe, under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his <hi>Wings.</hi> For O how many have gone to Bed <hi>well,</hi> and ſlept their <hi>Laſt?</hi> And from their <hi>Beds,</hi> been Carried to lye in the <hi>Duſt;</hi> Never to <hi>Wake</hi> again, till the great Morning of the <hi>Laſt</hi> Day?

            <p n="2">2. Take care of the <hi>Frequent Returns</hi> of your Prayers.

Will the Hypocrite Delight himſelf in the Almighty?

            </p>
            <p>Some Families are for Prayers only on the <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> at Night; and then the Lord ſhall have no more of them for a <hi>Week.</hi> They'll not come near him, till that Day <hi>Se'nnight</hi> again. But do not make ſuch Fearful <hi>Chaſms</hi> and <hi>Interruptions,</hi> I beſeech you. For <hi>every</hi> Day is the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-Day; and a Day of <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and a <hi>Prayer</hi>-Day; wherein your Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father <hi>Expects</hi> you: And wherein you (I am ſure,) do full as much <hi>Need</hi> Him. And count it as <hi>Strange</hi> and Unuſual with you, to <hi>Suſpend</hi> your Prayers, as your Meals: Yea to have your Prayers at a <hi>Stand,</hi> as to have your Breath <hi>ſtopt:</hi> For Prayer is the very <hi>Breath</hi> of Religion; without which it is <hi>ſuffocated</hi> and ſtifled, and cannot be kept <hi>Alive,</hi> in the <hi>Family,</hi> or in the <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let the Lord only Hear of you at the <hi>Pinch</hi> and <hi>Extremity;</hi> when nothing but mere <hi>Dread</hi> forces you upon it. Leſt you find the ſad <hi>Diſappointment,</hi> of Beginning an <hi>Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> then; and ſeek in <hi>Vain,</hi> becauſe you would not ſeek <hi>Before.</hi> But let Prayer be moe in <hi>Faſhion</hi> with you, and more <hi>Common</hi> among you. Be Ready to it, and Much in it: Till you have made you a <hi>Frequented</hi> Eaſy Path to the Throne of Grace. Let it be even as the <hi>Air,</hi> that you Breathe in; and as the <hi>Food</hi> that you Live on; and as the very <hi>Pulſe</hi> of your Souls. Carried on even <hi>without Ceaſing,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.17. <hi>i.e.</hi> Keep in a Conſtant <hi>Preparation</hi> for it; and be Ready, upon all Occaſions, to fall
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54105:49"/>into the <hi>Actual</hi> Exerciſe of it. That it may not be as a <hi>Predigious</hi> thing to you; but an <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day</hi>'s Buſineſs, and <hi>Familiar,</hi> even as your Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking.</p>
            <p>Now to Quicken you to ſuch <hi>Frequency</hi> of Prayer, Do but Conſider with me Three Things; That this is the <hi>Only</hi> Time for it: That the <hi>Oftner</hi> you thus come to God, you ſhall be the <hi>Welcomer:</hi> And that your Prayer, the more <hi>Frequent,</hi> is the more <hi>Excellent.</hi>
